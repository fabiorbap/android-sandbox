Repository to experiment with Android technologies

# Introduction

I created this repository to experiment with architectures, dependencies and personal ideas in Android.

Initially, this will be a simple CRUD app for users, which will allow me to experiment with many topics I'm interested in.
At this moment, it does not integrated with any server, but it will be integrated with Firebase in the future.

It is a repository in permanent change, as I intend to constantly experiment with it.

# Setup

You will need to install Android Studio and also the Android SDK. Follow the instructions [here](https://developer.android.com/studio)
to find out how.

After you have installed them, download the repository and open in Android Studio. Gradle will build it and you may
receive an error message prompting you to install some dependencies such as Build Tools.

Install all that is required until the build is successful.

# Configuration

This project has two [flavors](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants): App and Storybook

## App

This flavor comprises the actual app, where all the functionalities are available for testing.
